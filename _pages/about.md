# üë®‚Äçüéì Biography
Hello! This is Shenghao Xie. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, working with Prof. Lei Ma and Prof. Tiejun Huang. I am also a visiting student of [Tsinghua Statistical Artificial Intelligence & Learning (TSAIL)](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) Group, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/).

My long-term research goal is to pursue vision AGI and create social good. Recent interests have primarily focuses on vision foundation models and their applications:

¬∑ **Generalist Vision Foundation Model.** Beyond task-specific breakthroughs, I am devoted to design effective algorithms that enable foundation models to integrately process various vision data (*e.g.,* 2D, 3D images, and videos) and tasks (*e.g.,* both perception and generation), ultimately unlocking the vision scaling law and zero-shot generalization.

¬∑ **Physics-informed 3D Vision.** At both the object-level and scene-level, I try to introduce physical constraints and accurate representations to 3D vision to support better world simulation and embodied interaction.

¬∑ **Medical Image Analysis.** Based on the clinical requirement and imaging characteristic, I seek to develop AI systems to complementarily assist doctors in the disease diagnosis.

If you are interested in discussing with me, please feel free to send me an email.
