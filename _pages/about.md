# üë®‚Äçüéì Biography
Hi! This is Shenghao Xie. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, working with [Prof. Lei Ma](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/sysgk/sysrygk.htm) and [Prof. Tiejun Huang](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/sysgk/sysrygk.htm). I am also a visiting student of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Hang Su](https://www.suhangss.me/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/).

My research interests focus on **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)** with their applications on **Embodied AI** and **AI for Healthcare**. I am open to both collaborations and discussions, please feel free to send me an email. **Address: Room for State Key Laboratory of Multimedia Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Peking University, 4th Floor, Founder Building.**
